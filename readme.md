# The Events Calendar: Gutenberg Extension

We've made significant rewrites and refactors of our products over the years, but adapting our plugins to fully integrate with the new editor coming in WordPress version 5.0, code-named "Gutenberg" **is the biggest ecosystem change weâ€™ve faced since the introduction of custom post types.**

This plugin is our first attempt at integrating the Event post type with the Gutenberg editor. Download this plugin as a .zip and install it on your site like any other plugin, or use the _Using developement Version from GitHub_ steps below.

:warning: **Please Note:** This is an Alpha-version plugin at this point; while we test thoroughly and hope to code well, _we do not recommend running this on production sites_.
